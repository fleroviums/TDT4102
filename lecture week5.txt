Week 5


#Repetition, struct
struct Date {
	int year;
	int month;
	int day;
	}
int main(){
	Date myBirthday;
	myBirthday.year = 1990;
	myBirthday.month = ...;
	...

# year, month and day are public member variables when using struct
# If we had used "class Date {..}", the variables couldn't be changed, only the class.
