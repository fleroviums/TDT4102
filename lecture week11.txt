		Pointers
* Initialize pointer to nullptr, never undefined (int* tPtr; no no)

		Dynamic memory mgt
* Can reserve memory during runtime and not only compilation
* int* p_int = new int{4};
	- Person* p_person = new Person[size]; /#person-obj
* Objects allocated dynamically survive a scope, e.g. in  a fuction
* To avoid memory leakage, use delete / delete[]
	* Set pointer variable to nullptr after

		Destructors
* Only think about it when using dynamic memory (and some times statics)
